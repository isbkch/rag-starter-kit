# 2. Technology Stack and Rationale

This document outlines the key technologies used in the Enterprise RAG Platform and the rationale for their selection. Our goal is to use modern, performant, and well-supported technologies that are suited for building a scalable, enterprise-grade service.

## Backend

* **Python 3.13+**: The primary language for the backend. Chosen for its extensive ecosystem of libraries for data science, machine learning, and web development, which is ideal for a RAG platform.
* **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs.
  * **Rationale**: Its asynchronous nature (based on ASGI) allows for high throughput, which is critical for handling concurrent API requests. It also includes automatic data validation and OpenAPI documentation generation, which improves developer productivity and API clarity.
* **Celery**: A distributed task queue.
  * **Rationale**: Document ingestion can be a time-consuming process. Celery allows us to offload these tasks to background workers, preventing API timeouts and ensuring a responsive user experience. It also provides for scalability, as we can add more workers to handle increased load.
* **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).
  * **Rationale**: It provides a reliable and flexible way to interact with the PostgreSQL database. The ORM simplifies database operations, while the core toolkit allows for writing raw SQL when performance optimization is needed.

## Frontend

* **React 19.1.0 & TypeScript**: A popular library for building user interfaces, with TypeScript for static typing.
  * **Rationale**: React's component-based architecture facilitates the creation of a modular and maintainable UI. TypeScript adds type safety, which helps catch errors early and improves code quality, a necessity for enterprise applications.
* **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool.
  * **Rationale**: Vite offers a significantly faster development experience compared to traditional bundlers, with near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.
  * **Rationale**: It allows for rapid UI development by composing utility classes directly in the markup, leading to a consistent and easily customizable design system.

## Databases & Search

* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
  * **Rationale**: Chosen for its reliability, feature robustness, and strong community support. It serves as the primary store for structured data like document metadata.
* **Redis**: An in-memory data store.
  * **Rationale**: Used for multiple purposes: as a message broker for Celery, for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load, and for implementing rate limiting.
* **Vector Database (ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate)**: Specialized databases for vector embeddings.
  * **Rationale**: Vector databases are essential for performing efficient semantic search. The platform supports multiple providers to avoid vendor lock-in and allow users to choose the best fit for their needs. An abstraction layer ensures they are interchangeable.
* **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine.
  * **Rationale**: Used for its powerful full-text search capabilities, specifically BM25 keyword search. This complements the semantic search from the vector database, enabling a more robust hybrid search.

## Infrastructure

* **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
  * **Rationale**: It simplifies the local development setup by allowing developers to spin up the entire application stack with a single command. It also ensures consistency between development and production environments.
