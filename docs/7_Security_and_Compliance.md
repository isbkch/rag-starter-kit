# 7. Security and Compliance

This document outlines the security features and compliance considerations for the Enterprise RAG Platform. Security is a critical aspect of the platform, and this guide provides an overview of the measures in place.

## Authentication and Authorization

* **API Key Authentication**: The backend API is protected by an API key authentication scheme, implemented in `app/core/auth.py`. Clients must provide a valid API key in the `Authorization` header to access protected endpoints.
* **Scoped Access**: While the current implementation uses a single API key, it can be extended to support more granular, role-based access control (RBAC) if required.

## Secret Management

Sensitive information such as API keys, database URLs, and other credentials should be managed securely. In a production environment, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated secret management tool like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Cloud Secret Manager, rather than storing secrets in `.env` files.

## Rate Limiting

To protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage, a token bucket rate-limiting algorithm is implemented in `app/core/rate_limiting.py`. This helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures the API remains available for all users.

## Data Privacy and Encryption

* **Data in Transit**: All communication between the frontend, backend, and external services should be encrypted using TLS/SSL.
* **Data at Rest**:
  * **PostgreSQL**: Most managed database providers offer encryption at rest by default.
  * **Vector Databases**: Refer to the documentation of your chosen vector database provider for information on their encryption-at-rest capabilities.
  * **Document Content**: The platform does not encrypt document content by default. If you are handling sensitive data, consider implementing application-level encryption before storing document chunks.

## Input Validation

FastAPI automatically validates all incoming request data based on the Pydantic models defined for each endpoint. This helps prevent common web vulnerabilities such as injection attacks by ensuring that all input conforms to the expected schema.

## Compliance

* **GDPR/CCPA**: If you are processing personal data, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations like GDPR or CCPA. This includes handling data subject requests (e.g., for access or deletion) and ensuring a legal basis for processing.
* **Data Deletion**: The platform provides an API endpoint for deleting documents. When a document is deleted, its metadata is removed from PostgreSQL, and the corresponding data is deleted from the vector database and Elasticsearch index.

## Security Best Practices

* **Regularly rotate API keys and other credentials.**
* **Keep all dependencies up to date** to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Run regular security scans** of your container images and application code.
* **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Ensure that each component only has the permissions it needs to perform its function.
